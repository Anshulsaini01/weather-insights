Weather Insight Dashboard 🌦️
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a data analytics dashboard using a Weather API. The dashboard fetches real‑time weather data for 5 cities and presents it in an interactive, visual format. It highlights temperature, humidity, wind speed, and overall conditions, enabling quick insights into weather trends.
⚙️ Features
Fetches live weather data from a public Weather API.
Covers 5 selected cities simultaneously.
Displays key metrics: temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
Interactive dashboard built with Power BI / Tableau / Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Clean visualizations for comparative analysis across cities.
🛠️ Tech Stack
